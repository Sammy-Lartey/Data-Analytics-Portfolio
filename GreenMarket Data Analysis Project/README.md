## 1. Introduction

At GreenMarket, our mission is to deliver fresh, high-quality fruits and vegetables while using data-driven insights to optimize sales and distribution. This report breaks down our sales data, analyzing total revenue, average sales, and performance across different countries and product categories.

By studying these trends, we can identify which products drive the most revenue, how different markets respond to our offerings, and where new opportunities exist. The findings show that fruits make up a larger share of total sales, with bananas leading the way, while vegetables maintain a strong presence in select regions.

Additionally, this report includes interactive slicers, allowing for flexible data exploration by product, region, and category. These insights will help refine pricing, inventory, and marketing strategies to maximize sales and meet customer demand more effectively.
