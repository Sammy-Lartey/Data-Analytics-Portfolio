# Data-Analytics-Portfolio
A collection of data analytics projects demonstrating my skills in data cleaning and manipulation, SQL querying, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization. Using tools like Python, MySQL, Power BI, and Microsoft Excel, I analyze datasets, uncover insights, and create interactive dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.
