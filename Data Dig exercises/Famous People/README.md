# Data Dig Project: Famous People

## Project Overview

The **Famous People Data Dig** project was designed as a hands-on exercise to improve SQL and data analytics skills using MySQL. It involved the creation and exploration of an **ENTERTAINMENT_DB** database, structured to store information about famous individuals, their movies, songs, awards, and the connections between them.

The objective was to practice SQL queries and database management by analyzing relationships between artists, their contributions, and the commercial success of their work within a structured dataset.

## Database Schema and Tables

The database consists of five main tables:

- **People Table**: Stores details of famous individuals, including their name, birth date, nationality, and profession (Actor, Singer, or Both).
- **Movies Table**: Contains information about movies, including title, release year, revenue, and region of success.
- **Songs Table**: Holds song details such as title, release year, revenue, and region of success.
- **Awards Table**: Records awards won by individuals, including award name, category, year won, and the associated person.
- **Connections Table**: Maps relationships between individuals and their involvement in movies and songs.

## Data Population

The dataset was manually created for learning purposes and includes:

- **20 individuals** spanning different roles in entertainment.
- **10 movies** across multiple genres.
- **10 songs** with varying degrees of commercial success.
- **10 awards**, distributed among different individuals.
- **Connections** linking people to their respective movies and songs.

This dataset is entirely fictional and was designed solely for improving database querying and analysis skills.

## Exploring the Data

To extract meaningful insights, a series of SQL queries were executed, including:

- **Listing all movies**: Retrieving all movies from the database along with their details.
- **Identifying the highest-grossing movie**: Sorting movies by revenue to determine the most commercially successful film.
- **Determining the most awarded individual**: Counting the number of awards received by each person.
- **Extracting all award-winning actors**: Filtering actors who have received awards, along with the specific awards and years won.
- **Identifying multi-talented individuals**: Finding individuals who are both actors and singers.
- **Analyzing the highest-earning songs**: Ranking songs by revenue to identify the top three highest-grossing tracks.

Each query reinforced key concepts in data extraction, relational database management, and SQL query optimization.

## Additional Data Insertions

To enhance the scope of the project, additional movies, songs, and awards were introduced, covering different regions and genres. These additions provided a more comprehensive dataset for analysis, including:

- **Movies**: A diverse mix spanning multiple genres.
- **Songs**: A variety of compositions with different levels of commercial performance.
- **Awards**: Recognitions across different sectors of the entertainment industry.

## Insights and Findings

Although the dataset was fictional, the project provided valuable insights, including:

âœ… Strengthening SQL query-writing skills.  
âœ… Understanding relationships between entities in a structured database.  
âœ… Simulating entertainment industry trends within a controlled dataset.  
âœ… Enhancing data manipulation and analysis techniques.

## Conclusion

This project served as an effective exercise in database design, SQL querying, and data analysis. By constructing and querying **ENTERTAINMENT_DB**, it provided the opportunity to:

âœ” Develop and manage a relational database.  
âœ” Optimize SQL query strategies for extracting meaningful insights.  
âœ” Apply database management concepts in a structured, analytical environment.  

The project reinforced the importance of structured data management and efficient SQL querying in data analytics.
